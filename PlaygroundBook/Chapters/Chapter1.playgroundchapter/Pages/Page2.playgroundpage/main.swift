/*:
 Standing under a tree is probably the worst place to be in a thunderstorm.
 Lightning bolts are caused by a difference of electric potential between the ground and the clouds.
 Then, a gigantic sparkle will be formed between them. But, the air between the ground and the sky has a high electric resistance.
 So, the sparkle will go through everything in contact with the ground, to travel across less air.

 That's why lightning bolts usually strike highest points.
 Trees are no exceptions; as you can experiment on this page, the bolt will most of the time strike the tree, no matter where it is.
