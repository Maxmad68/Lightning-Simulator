 An airplane act as a Faraday Cage. It means the inside of the plane is totally isolated from the electomagnetics fields generated outside. Passengers and all equipments are totally safe.
 To help lightnings finding their way through the aircraft, it has been designed to facilitate the conduction of the electricity to the tail or the wings.
 On average, every passenger airplane is stuck by a lightning about once a year.
